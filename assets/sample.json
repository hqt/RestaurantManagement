Neta and forms of sushi presentation vary, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is vinegared rice called sushi-meshi.\r\n\r\nThe original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (\u99b4\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \u719f\u5bff\u53f8,) was first made in Southeast Asia, possibly along what is now known as the Mekong River. And then sushi cuisine spread to southern China before it was introduced in Japan.[citation needed] The term sushi comes from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts; literally, sushi means \"sour-tasting\", a reflection of its historic fermented roots. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, still very closely resembles this process, wherein fish is fermented via being wrapped in soured fermenting rice. The fish proteins break down via fermentation into its constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish results in a sour taste and also one of the five basic tastes, called umami in Japanese.[1] In Japan, narezushi evolved into oshizushi and ultimately Edomae nigirizushi, which is what the world today knows as \"sushi\".","Discount":"10.0","DishID":3,"DishImage":"sushi.jpg","DishName":"Sushi","Price":"500.0","Tag":"food,japanese,evening","created_at":"2013-03-24T11:21:41Z","id":3,"updated_at":"2013-03-24T11:21:41Z"}]
