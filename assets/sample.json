Neta and forms of sushi presentation vary, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is vinegared rice called sushi-meshi.\r\n\r\nThe original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (\u99b4\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \u719f\u5bff\u53f8,) was first made in Southeast Asia, possibly along what is now known as the Mekong River. And then sushi cuisine spread to southern China before it was introduced in Japan.[citation needed] The term sushi comes from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts; literally, sushi means \"sour-tasting\", a reflection of its historic fermented roots. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, still very closely resembles this process, wherein fish is fermented via being wrapped in soured fermenting rice. The fish proteins break down via fermentation into its constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish results in a sour taste and also one of the five basic tastes, called umami in Japanese.[1] In Japan, narezushi evolved into oshizushi and ultimately Edomae nigirizushi, which is what the world today knows as \"sushi\".","Discount":"10.0","DishID":3,"DishImage":"sushi.jpg","DishName":"Sushi","Price":"500.0","Tag":"food,japanese,evening","created_at":"2013-03-24T11:21:41Z","id":3,"updated_at":"2013-04-01T03:25:15Z"},{"BuyNum":4,"Currency":"VND","Description":"The main structure of a roll of ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 is commonly seasoned ground meat, mushrooms, and diced vegetables such as carrots, kohlrabi and jicama, rolled up in a sheet of moist rice paper.

If diced carrots and jicama are used, the stuffing is a little bit crunchy, matching the crispy fried rice paper, but the juice from these vegetables can cause the rolls to soften after a short time. If the rolls are to be stored for a long time, mashed sweet potato or mung beans may be used instead to keep the rolls crispy. One may also include bean sprouts and rice vermicelli. Eggs and various spices can be added to one's preference. Sometimes, the ingredients can include julienned taro root and carrots if jicama cannot be found.

The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.[1] Yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different types of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, and human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.\r\n\r\nWines made from fruits besides grapes are usually named after the fruit from which they are produced (for example, pomegranate wine, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine.
